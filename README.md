## Screenshots:
After login, the Metronics user is greeted with an overview of their business operations. They take quick actions to add new customers, new service jobs, or parts to inventory. A filtered list of parts that are low in inventory is displayed so that they know what to re-order. They can also see any new service jobs that have yet to be contacted and scheduled.

Gone are the days of manually searching through inventory to find out if they have the parts they need. Now they search through a database of parts to discover what they have in stock.
